## Core

  Where all the API Models and Extensions are created

## VanillaSwiftUI

  The classes used to create the app in the Pure SwiftUI way
  
## TCASwiftUI

  The classes used to create the app in the TCA SwiftUI way

If you compare the classes from both targets you can also understand how similar is TCASwiftUI to pure VanillaSwiftUI way of building apps
